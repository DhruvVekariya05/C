    <p>Q1.What is software? What is software engineering? </p><br>
    <span>ANS:-</span>
    <p>Software is considered to be collection of executable programming code, associated libraries and documentations. Software, when made for a specific requirement is called software product. Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.</p>

    <p>Q2.Explain types of software</p><br>
    <span>ANS:-</span>
    <p>The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An application is software that fulfills a specific need or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.</p>

    <p>Q3.</p><br>
    <span>ANS:-</span><br>
    <p>SDLC is the acronym of Software Development Life Cycle. It is also called as Software Development Process. SDLC is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes.</p>

    <p>Q4.</p><br>
    <span>ANS:-</span><br>
    <p>A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical or visual representation using a standardized set of symbols and notations to describe a business's operations through data movement. They are often elements of a formal methodology such as Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM).</p>

    <p>Q5.What is Flow chart? Create a flowchart to make addition of two numbers</p><br>
    <span>ANS:-</span><br>
    <p>Algorithm: To find the sum and product of two given numbers: Step 1: Read A , B Step 2: Let Sum= A+B Step 3: Let Product=A*B Step 4: Print Sum, Product Step 5: Stop. Ex 2: Develop an algorithm to interchange the values assigned to two variables A and B.</p>

    <p>Q6.What is Use case Diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm</p><br>
    <span>ANS:-</span><br>
    <p>Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a system. These diagrams also identify the interactions between the system and its actors. The use cases and actors in use-case diagrams describe what the system does and how the actors use it, but not how the system operates internally.</p>
